     * Declaring beans in {@link JavaConfig} advantages:
     * - It is simple (if it is necessary) to migrate from SCOPE_SINGLETON to to create instances of the class with factory to launch several class instances in parallel.
     * - It is easier to use special "test" beans instead of production ones.
     * "Test" (mocked) bean is a another "test" (mocked) class, implementing the interface provided by bean. The "test" (mocked) class can be implemented with extending product class and overriding methods.
     * It's just necessary to declare JavaConfig in TestClass and mark @Bean {@link CreationalPattern.Factory.FactoryMethod} with @Primary or @Profile.
     * - It is easier to determine (read from source) all the app beans declarations (including @Scope), since all of the dependencies are in one place in {@link JavaConfig}
     * Injecting dependencies in constructor disadvantages:
     * - It adds boilerplate code (declaring @Bean {@link CreationalPattern.Factory.FactoryMethod} and its parameters) in {@link JavaConfig}.
     * Name pattern of {@link JavaConfig} is *Config.
     * <p>
     * Rule of thumb:
     * Start to declare all the @Bean {@link CreationalPattern.Factory.FactoryMethod} methods in single {@link JavaConfig} class named f.e. MainAppConfig;

     * Note: Separate class built with {@link CreationalPattern.Factory} can be replaced with {@link JavaConfig}.{@link CreationalPattern.Factory.FactoryMethod},
     * if it's constructor contains the dependencies provided with beans only. If the constructor contains at least one non-dependency parameter,
     * a separate class built with {@link CreationalPattern.Factory} is required.
     * The class with {@link CreationalPattern.Factory} is a Bean with @Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_SINGLETON).

    /**
     * See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency injection</a>
     * dependency injection is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object.
     * A dependency is an object that can be used (a service).
     * An injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object (a client) that would use it.
     * The service is made part of the client's state.[1] Passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service,
     * is the fundamental requirement of the pattern.
     * Dependency injection is one form of the broader technique of inversion of control. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">Inversion of control</a>
     * Rather than low level code calling up to high level code, high level code can receive lower level code that it can call down to.
     * This inverts the typical control pattern seen in procedural programming.
     *
     * http://www.baeldung.com/spring-interview-questions
     * The recommended approach is to use {@link Constructor} arguments for mandatory dependencies and setters for optional ones.
     * {@link Constructor} {@link Injection} allows injecting values to immutable fields and makes testing easier.
