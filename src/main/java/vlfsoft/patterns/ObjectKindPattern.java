     *
     * data class PersonId (val value: Long)
     * data class FirstName (val value: String)

     * The Value Objects pattern transforms values in our projects into real objects, giving us more type safety, hiding implementation, and giving a home to all related logic.
     * That being said, we should always evaluate if the mentioned benefits outweigh the drawbacks of creating extra classes, which, in Java,
     * implies extra source files and a rapidly growing size of the project.
     * To implement a value object, we simply wrap a value into an immutable class with an equals/hashcode pair that compares the objects by values.
