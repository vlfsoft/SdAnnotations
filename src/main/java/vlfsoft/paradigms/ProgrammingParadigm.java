/**
 * See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">Programming paradigm</a>
 * Way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.
 * Common programming paradigms include: <ul>
 * <li> imperative which allows side effects {@link Imperative},
 * <li> functional which disallows side effects {@link Declarative.Functional},
 * <li> declarative which does not state the order in which operations execute {@link Declarative},
 * <li> object-oriented which groups code together with the state the code modifies {@link Structured.ObjectOriented},
 * <li> procedural which groups code into functions {@link Imperative.Procedural},
 * <li> logic which has a particular style of execution model coupled to a particular style of syntax and grammar {@link Declarative.Logic}, and
 * <li> symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and grammar {@link Symbolic}.
 * </ul>
