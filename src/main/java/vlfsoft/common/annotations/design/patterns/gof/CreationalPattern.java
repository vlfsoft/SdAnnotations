     * This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface
     * and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden
     * by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.
     *
     * Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
     * Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses

     * In normal usage, the client software creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic interface
     * of the factory to create the concrete objects that are part of the theme.
     * The client doesn't know (or care) which concrete objects it gets from each of these internal factories,
     * since it uses only the generic interfaces of their products.
     * This pattern separates the details of implementation of a set of objects from their general usage and relies on object composition,
     * as object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface.

     * The telescoping constructor anti-pattern occurs when the increase of object constructor parameter combination leads to an exponential
     * list of constructors. Instead of using numerous constructors, the builder pattern uses another object, a builder,
     * that receives each initialization parameter step by step and then returns the resulting constructed object at once.
     * The builder pattern has another benefit.
     * It can be used for objects that contain flat data (html code, SQL query, X.509 certificate...),
     * that is to say, data that can't be easily edited.
     * This type of data can't be edited step by step and must be edited at once.
